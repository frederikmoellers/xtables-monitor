# xtables-monitor
Write firewall rules using templates!

You want to have a firewall on your laptop? You want to have an IPv4/6 server with a single ruleset? You don't want to grow old writing firewall rules and adapting them? Use the power of templates to solve all these problems!

Using `xtables-monitor`, you can write a single set of rules for both IPv4 and IPv6 and you can effortlessly have your firewall adapt to your environment by referencing current network settings from your ruleset.

## Installation
Run `setup.py install`. It should automatically check for (Python) dependencies and will install the package.
Copy the examples to or create your own templates in `/etc/xtables-monitor`.

## Dependencies
* Python >= 3.5
* ip[6]tables-save and ip[6]tables-restore
* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
* [netifaces](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces)

## How to write rules
Check the examples directory. `xtables-monitor` is based on Jinja2 and uses its template mechanism. A more detailed documentation will follow.

## How to apply rules
Use the `-a` command line switch.

## How to react to IP address changes
For the moment, you have to install hooks in `/etc/network/if-*.d` manually or call the execuable yourself. In a future version, `xtables-monitor` may be able to react to IP address changes automatically.

## Example
``` bash
$ xtm -i 4 examples/lan.xtm
```

```
